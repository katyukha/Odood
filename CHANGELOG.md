## Release 0.3.0 (2025-03-14)

### Added

- New command `odood translations regenerate` that allows to regenerate translations for modules.
  Could be useful to automatically or semiautomatically generate `.po` and `.pot` files for modules.
  Also, this command available as shortcut `odood tr regenerate`.
- New flag `--no-install-addons` added to `odood test`.
  It could be used to speed up running tests on localc machine on same db.

### Changed

- **Breaking** Changed approach to docker images. No more custom entry point.
  Just single option (on application level), that allows to update Odoo configuration from environment variables.
  Default command uses this option. but custom commands will need to use this option.
  Currently, this requires explicit specification of this command on Odood runs.
  This may be changed in future.
- **Breaking** Do not use separate config file for tests on deployments (Odoo installations installed via `odood deploy` command)

---

## Release 0.2.2 (2025-03-10)

### Added

- Experimental support for [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) integration.

### Changed

- Replace [dpq](https://code.dlang.org/packages/dpq) with [Peque](https://code.dlang.org/packages/peque)
- `odood script py` command: now output of script will be redirected on stdout.
   Thus no more need to wait while script completed to get intermediate output of script.


---

## Release 0.2.1 (2025-01-23)

### Changed

- Added new command `entrypoint` that is available only in version for docker images,
  that is used as *entrypoint* for docker container and that is responsible for applying
  configuration from environment variables to Odoo configuration file before
  any further action.
- Added new command `odood odoo recompute` that allows to recompute computed fields for specified model in specified database.


---

## Release 0.2.0 (2024-12-12)

### Added

- New experimental command `odood deploy` that could be used to deploy production-ready Odoo instance.
- Added experimental support for Odoo 18
- Added new command `odood repo fix-series` that allows to set series for all modules in repo to project's serie.
- Added automatic builds of docker images with pre-installed Odoo.

### Changed

- Pre-commit related commands moved to `pre-commit` subcommand.
  Thus, following commands now available to work with pre-commit:
    - `odood pre-commit init`
    - `odood pre-commit set-up`
    - `odood pre-commit run`
- Change command `odood server run`. Command uses `execv` to run Odoo,
  thus, Odoo process will replace Odood process. Thus, option `--detach`
  is not available here. If you want to start Odoo in background, then
  `odood server start` command exists. Instead, this command (`odood server run`)
  is designed to run Odoo with provided args in same way as you run Odoo binary directly.
  For example, following command
  `odood server run -- -d my_database --install=crm --stop-after-init`,
  that will install `crm` module, will be translated to `odoo -d my_database --install=crm --stop-after-init`,
  that will be ran inside virtualenv of current Odood project.
    - Added new option `--ignore-running` that allows to ignore server running.
    - Removed option `--detach` as it does not have sense. Use `odood server start` instead.
- Changed generation of default test db name.
  Before it was: `odood<serie>-odood-test`
  Now it will be: `<db_user>-odood-test`

### Changed

- Installation of dependencies from manifest is now optional.
  It is frequent case, when authors of module place incorrect dependencies
  in manifest, thus installation of addon may fail.

### Fixes

- Fix error when running `addons install/update/uninstall` with non-existing
  logfile. This was caused by attempt to determine starting point of logfile
  to search for errors happened during operation.
  Now this case is handled correctly.
